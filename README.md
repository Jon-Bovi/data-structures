# data-structures

Sample code (with tests) for classic data structures implemented in Python.

## Linked List

- Can be initialized with (or without) iterable argument.

- Attributes:

    - head: first node in linked list

- Methods:

    - pop(): remove head and return its value

    - push(value): insert new node at head of list

    - remove(node): find and remove node from list

    - search(value): find and return first node with value equal to argument

    - display(): print list in pseudo-tuple format

## Stack

- Can be initialized with (or without) iterable argument.

- Attributes:

    - top: top/first node on stack

- Methods:

    - pop(): remove head and return its value

    - push(value): insert new node at head of list

    - size/len: return size of stack

## Doubly-Linked List

- Can be initialized with (or without) iterable argument.

- Methods:

    - push(value): insert value at head of list

    - append(value): add value to tail of list

    - pop(): remove head and return its value

    - shift(): remove tail and return its value

    - remove(val): remove first instance of value in list, or raise exception if no matches
